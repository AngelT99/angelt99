# Individual Projects



## Web-Crawler

#### Description:
- This project was to crawl a website. I used socket programming, which is fundamental to writing all internet applications, and also about the HTTP application layer protocol. 
- The program will be given a URL on the command line, pointing to an HTML page. The program will be called crawler and it might, for example, be invoked as: crawler http://web1.comp30023 The program will first fetch the indicated HTML page. The program will then recursively follow all hypertext links (href="..." attributes in <a ...> anchor tags) and fetch the indicated pages if all but the first components of the host match the host of the URL on the command line.
  
#### Technologies used: 
**C, HTTP application, Socket API**
